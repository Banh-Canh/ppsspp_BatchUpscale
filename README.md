## Descriptions

Batch scripts to upscales ppsspp textures dumps using: https://github.com/JoeyBallentine/ESRGAN (required).

Require ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org

To be usable you need to edit and configure "UPSCALE PPSSPP Games.bat".

## How to use

All of theses scripts must be in the same folder.

Configure UPSCALE PPSSPP Games.bat (write in your PPSSPP memstick path, ESRGAN or other 'plugins' paths).

Double click on UPSCALE PPSSPP Games.bat to start the script (I recommend making a backup of your texture dump before doing so).

Enter the game you want to upscale.

## Features

* The model and settings used should minimize artifacts due to AI upcaling (meaning it is meant to work 'universally' but isn't meant to be the best model/settings for a specific game)

* Automatically creates a backup of both the dump and the upscaled textures
* Check for duplicates and auto-add them to the [hashes] sections

## What it does not

* Organize the texture pack: all upscaled textures will still have the default name and be in the default folder.
* Give the best upscaled texture possible
